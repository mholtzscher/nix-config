description: Remove AI code slop
---

Check the diff against `main`, and remove all AI-generated slop introduced in this branch.

This includes:

- Extra comments that a human would not add or that are inconsistent with the rest of the file
- Extra defensive checks or `try`/`catch` blocks that are abnormal for that area of the codebase, especially if called by trusted or validated code paths
- Casts to `any` to get around type issues
- Any other style that is inconsistent with the file

Report at the end with only a 1-3 sentence summary of what you changed.
